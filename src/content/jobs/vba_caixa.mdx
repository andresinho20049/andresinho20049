These projects are for academic purposes, but during the period I worked at Pinturas Floren√ßa, several of my spreadsheets were used to assist in the company's activities.

For example:
  - Alert when employee is close to experience
  - Alert when due date and/or receipt is close to date
  - Generate report with planning based on data selected in listview

# About
The spreadsheet is designed to efficiently store and manage financial data relating to expenses and revenues, with specific sheets allocated for distinct types of expenditures and incomes. 
The report sheets are derived from templates and used to generate PDF reports. A control spreadsheet functions as a dashboard, providing an overview of the financial data.

# Tools
 - Excel 2007 (32bits)
 - listview
 - userForms
 - macros

```VBA
Sub report_PDF()

    Plan6.Activate
    
    ActiveSheet.ExportAsFixedFormat Type:=xlTypePDF, Filename:=ActiveWorkbook.Path _
    & "\Report " & Format(Now, "dd-mm-yy hh-MM-ss") & ".pdf", Quality:= _
    xlQualityStandard, IncludeDocProperties:=False, IgnorePrintAreas:=False, OpenAfterPublish:=True

End Sub
```
